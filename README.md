## __Exercise 2: secret message__

The creator has hidden 3 secret messages in older versions of the webpage.  
Luckily for us, git works just like a time machine!  

Let's have a look, open the webpage with the following command:  
+ $firefox home.html (Replace 'firefox' if you are using a different browser)  
+ Checkout an older commit  
+ Refresh the homepage in the browser  

Steps to complete the exercise:  
1. Make sure you are on the 'website' branch  
2. Checkout a new branch 'website-yourname'  
3. Detach HEAD and traverse the commit history  
4. Find a hidden message (e.g. MESSAGE1: somemessage)  
5. Return HEAD to most recent commit on your branch  
6. Fill in all secret messages below  
7. Push the messages upstream  

SECRET MESSAGE 1 = ""  
SECRET MESSAGE 2 = ""  
SECRET MESSAGE 3 = ""
