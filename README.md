## __Exercise 4. exquisite corpse__  

Who says writing a story can't be a group effort?  
The more people contribute the crazier it'll become.  
Make sure to keep it sensible and we'll be left with a masterpiece!  

1. From the exquisite branch checkout a new branch with your name  
2. Add a sensible sentence to the story in file "exquisite.md"  
3. End each line with 2 extra spaces (markdown)  
4. Commit your addition, checkout main exquisite and merge with yours  
5. Solve any merge requests then push the merge upstream  
(if story doesn't make sense due to the merge try to add a sentence)  

Optional  
6. Do a pull request on the exquisite corpse  
7. Add more to the story after your receive the addition of others
