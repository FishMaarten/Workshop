## __Exercise 3: cherry-pick monstrocity__

Someone made a grave mistake and created 3 failed experiments.  
Now the animals are in trouble and need your help.  
Checkout the failed creations on the following branches:  
+ experiment-cat  
+ experiment-dog  
+ experiment-fish  

Investigate what went wrong:  
+ Run experiment.py ($python experiment.py)  
+ Read the scientist's *logs*  
+ Can you spot any *difference*  

Steps to complete the exercise:  
1. Make sure you're on the 'monstrocity' branch  
2. Checkout a new branch 'monstrocity-yourname'  
3. Cherry-pick the right commits to bring one of the creatures to life  
4. Test your new creation by running the experiment.py  
5. Push your creation upstream  
"git reset monstrocity" will reset your experiment back to the start
