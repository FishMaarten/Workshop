(Author: Maarten Fish)

## Welcome to the Git Workshop  

### What we are doign today:  

1. Start with a show-and-tell  
	+ Why git?  
	+ Detached HEAD  
	+ Logs and reading git  
	+ Fixing mistakes  
	+ .gitignore file  
	+ Booking "The-Watch"  

2. Some light-hearted excersise  
	1. Go to the previous commit using "git checkout HEAD~"  
	  (the commit is tagged "info" so you can also "git checkout info"  
	   you will have to "git fetch --tags" to populate your logs with tags)  
	2. There you will find which branches contain which exercises  
	3. nano or vim the README.md for all the infomation and to-do  

3. Q&A: questions, answers and more examples
