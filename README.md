## __Exercise 1: git detective__  

A detective from the Git Intelligence Agency has asked your help with an ongoing investigation.  
He is currently looking into the Repository History and needs your keen eye on the job.  
Disclosed under this branch you'll find a file that, when completed, could get you a promotion to Git Guru.  
Hack into the jupyter-notebook to get started. God speed.  

Steps to complete the exercise:  
1. Make sure you're on the 'detective' branch  
2. Checkout a new branch 'detective-yourname'  
3. Copy the investigation.ipynb and rename to something personal  
4. Boot up jupyter-notebook  
5. Fill in the investigation form as detailed as possible  
6. Once finished return to your personal branch  
7. Save add and commit the file with a meaningful message  
8. Checkout the main detective branch and merge with yours  
9. Push the merge upstream  

NOTE: if you accidentally save your file while on another branch:  
- remove the file or check it 'out' and save it again after returning to your branch
